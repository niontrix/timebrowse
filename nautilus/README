TimeBrowse Nautilus Extension

This extension is meant to be used with the Nautilus File Manager,

Requirements:
    * nautilus
    * nautilus-python (python-nautilus in Debian/Ubuntu)
    * rsync
    * unoconv
    * pdftoppm(included in poppler-utils in Debian/Ubuntu)

To install:
    To install for all users, copy TimeBrowse.py to:
        /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/python
    
    To install for a single user, copy TimeBrowse.py to:
        ~/.nautilus/python-extensions
    
    In both cases, you may need to create the python/python-extensions folder.
    
    Restart nautilus with the following commands:
        $ nautilus -q
        $ nohup nautilus > /dev/null &

Usage:
    * if you run nautilus other than UTF-8 locale,  like C or POSIX
      you'd better to specify locale to generate thumbnail like following:

> class NILFS2PropertyPage(nautilus.PropertyPageProvider):
>    def __init__(self):
>        self.factory = PixbufFactory(lang="ja_JP.UTF-8")
>
>    def get_property_pages(self, files):

    but usually you don't need to specify

Known Issue:
    * a bit slow to create thumbnail
