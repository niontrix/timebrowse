TimeBrowse Nautilus Extension

This extension is meant to be used with the Nautilus File Manager,

Requirements:
    * nautilus
    * nautilus-python (python-nautilus in Debian/Ubuntu)
    * pisa (python-pisa in Debian/Ubuntu)
    * python-evince
    * rsync

To install:
    To install for all users, copy TimeBrowse.py to:
        /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/python
    
    To install for a single user, copy TimeBrowse.py to:
        ~/.nautilus/python-extensions
    
    In both cases, you may need to create the python/python-extensions folder.
    
    Restart nautilus with the following commands:
        $ nautilus -q
        $ nohup nautilus > /dev/null &

Known Issue:
    * Thumbnail for Japanese(may other Asians) plain text is not proper.
      This is the font problem.  You can hack the problem by
      specifying truetype font path in TimeBrowse.py, like following:

> class NILFS2PropertyPage(nautilus.PropertyPageProvider):
>    def __init__(self):
>        self.factory = PixbufFactory(font_path="/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-japanese-gothic.ttf")
>
>    def get_property_pages(self, files):

      Still, only UTF-8 encoded texts are supported so far.
